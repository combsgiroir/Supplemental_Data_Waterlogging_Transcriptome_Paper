# Supplemental_Data_Waterlogging_Transcriptome_Paper
This repository contains all supplemental data files referenced in "Morpho-physiological and transcriptomic responses of field pennycress to waterlogging"

The following is a brief explanation of the contents within each file:

-Supplemental_File_1_DEGs.xlsx : This file contains a list of all the differentially expressed genes in root, leaf, and pod tissues based on 3 conditions (control, 7d waterlogged, and 3HR recovery) and 2 accessions (MN106 and SP32-10).

-Supplemental_File_2_GSEA-GO.xlsx : This file contains the Gene Ontology (GO) terms of the clusterProfiler output from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of each analysis.

-Supplemental_File_3_GO-genes.xlsx : This file contains a list of the most significant DEGs and their Arabidopsis ortholog, log2FC, and padj. They are grouped by some of the most significant GO categories.

-Supplemental_File_4_GSEA-KEGG.xlsx : This file contains the KEGG terms of the clusterProfiler output from the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis of each analysis.

-Supplemental_File_5_139-DEGs.xlsx : This file contains a list of the 139 DEGs in the interaction of MN106 7d waterlogged vs control roots compared to SP32-10 7d waterlogged vs control roots (MN-7WL vs SP-7WL). Arabidopsis gene IDs and names are included.
